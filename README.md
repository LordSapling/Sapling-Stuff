# Ice Cold Beer Summary
The overall objective of the game is to see how many points you can score before failing to role the ball into the correct hole. You will be using a rod to maneuver a ball into a hole. Using only the ability to adjust the ends of the rod up or down to create a slope for the ball to role on. A lit indicator will inform the player on which hole to move the ball into.
